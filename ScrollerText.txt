This program is an OpenGL program written by Ayo Oshinnaiye in 2007 – the program simulates cloth through the use of a system of interconnected nodes. The nodes are connected by simulated springs; additionally, the forces of gravity, viscosity (air), and wind act on the nodes. The result is rendered as a grid of polygons, with the polygon vertices representing the simulated nodes. Please refer to ClothScroller_Info.txt for more information.
